                <h3>Biryani</h3>
                <div id="biryani" class="recipe">
                    Biryani came to Singapore and Malaysia from India but the dish originated in Persia (today's
                    Iran).The hearty, flavour and aroma packed meat and rice dish is one of the favourites in Malaysia
                    and Singapore cuisine.

                    The word biryani is derived from two Persian words. Birinj is the Persian word for "rice". The
                    Persian word Birian means "to fry before cooking" which succinctly sums up the basic method of
                    cooking biryani.

                <h3>Roti Canai</h3>
                <div id="roti-canai" class="recipe">
                    Roti Canai, the beloved Malaysian flatbread, is more than just a staple food but a cultural icon
                    that embodies the rich tapestry of Malaysian cuisine.
                    <br>
                    Originally from South India, this delectable dish has seamlessly woven its way into the hearts and
                    plates of Malaysians and become an integral part of their culinary heritage.
                    <br>
                    Roti Canai's journey to becoming Malaysia's national bread is a fascinating tale of cultural fusion
                    and adaptation.
                    <br>
                    Despite its Indian origins, this menu has evolved into a distinctly Malaysian dish, thanks to the
                    influence of Tamil immigrants who arrived in Malaysia during the colonial era.
                    <br>
                    Known as Indian Muslims or Mamaks, these immigrants brought with them not just their culinary
                    traditions but also their unique blend of spices, flavors, and cooking techniques.

                <h3>Chicken Tikka Masala</h3>
                <div id="CTM" class="recipe">
                    As well known, curries are many kinds of food that contain a complex combination of spices and
                    herbs, generally prepared in a sauce. Most commonly used ones are coriander, ginger, turmeric,
                    cumin, and of course chiles. These spices can be used either whole or ground and cooked or raw. With
                    the influence of Indian curries, Malaysia had found its own way. Rendang, tamarind, garlic, chilli
                    peppers, ginger, shallots, and coconut milk have become the most typical ingredients for Malaysian
                    curries.
                    <br>
                    Chicken Tikka Masala in Malaysia is a delightful fusion of Indian and Malay flavours, showcasing the
                    diversity and creativity of Malaysian cuisine. The marriage of aromatic spices, tender chicken, and
                    creamy coconut-based gravy creates an explosion of flavours that will leave your taste buds craving
                    more. Whether you're a fan of Indian cuisine, Malaysian food, or simply an adventurous foodie,
                    exploring the Malaysian rendition of Chicken Tikka Masala is a must-try experience that is sure to
                    delight your senses.
